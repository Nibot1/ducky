Meet **Ducky**, your adorable digital companion whom you can talk to, and rubber duck debug with. 

In addition to hanging around, Ducky is also responsible enough to set 15 minute alarms, should you want a short break soon, and not lose track of time.

Ducky is working on his memory and remembers the links to developer-friendly sites like StackOverflow, GitHub, Reddit and CodePen.

Ducky is also fairly shy, so don't try touching him with the mouse pointer or he may try dodging you. :wink:
